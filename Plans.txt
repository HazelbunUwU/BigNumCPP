Some of the major plans for the project as a whole:

-----------------------------------------
High level overviews:

Ints[0:10^19]:
  Arbitrary Length Arrays of parent for arbitrary precision integers:
    BigNum (Fully fledged IEEE 745-based floating point BigNum) capable of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (Proof of concept done in python with my HPF library)

-----------------------------------------
Lower level overview:

First implementation will probably be using ints ranging from 0 -> 10^19 to make string conversions and overflow detection easier.
The integers ranging from 0 to 10^19 should built-in carry bool for easier overflow and carry capability.

-----------------------------------------
Open questions for implementation details:

Should ALA (Arbitrary Length Array's of ints) be signed or unsigned, and should it be random access for each bit/int?
Thinking about it it probably shouldn't just to make the implementation within the main BigNum format easier to handle and understand.
