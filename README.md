# BigNumCPP
My own BigNum implementation in c++ <3

This is gonna be a revamp of my cpp-hpf project, but more planned through and having a better idea of how to work in c++ now.

!!!The manual will probably not be updated whilst plans are being created and changed in this branch properly.
This is the Work In Progress branch, meaning everything is not finalised, only things that's been thorougly and properly tested will go into the main branch.

Plans and discussions is in the plan.txt file where everything that need to be properly planned will be discussed through if not already put in Issues.
